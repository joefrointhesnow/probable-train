Two tests were made for the "Modify Activity Time" feature. 


The first test takes an existing activity and modifies its time. 
This is the happy test as the time successfully updates on the activity page.

The second test takes an existing activity and attempts to modify its time using negative integers. 
This is the sad test because activity times and durations cannot be negative integers, 
so the activity time is not updated and the user is informed of this.
