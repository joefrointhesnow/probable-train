For this iteration, a test was written for Creating an Activity with two scenarios. The first is for filling in 
all of the specified fields and submitting it (the happy path), and the final test was in case 
if the user did not fill out all of the specified fields (the sad path). 

I chose these by thinking about how the page should work in order to create the happy paths. As for 
the sad path, I thought about how sometimes users do not fill out all of the information that needs
to be provided.
