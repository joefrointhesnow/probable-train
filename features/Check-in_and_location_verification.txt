I wrote the feature, "Check-in and location verification".

This feature tests the apps ability to verify if the user is at an activities 
location, so they can begin to log hours as attended. 

The happy path is when the user is at the activites location and they see the
"location verified" icon. The sad path is when the user is not at that 
activities location and the app gives them the "location not verified" icon.
