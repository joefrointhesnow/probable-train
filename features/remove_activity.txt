Test was written for the remove activity feature with two scenarios. One of the scenarios is to make sure the user can
select the activities they wish to remove and be able to delete them after clicking on the delete button. That is the happy path. 
For the sad path, when the user selects the activities they wish to delete, the activities don't delete after clicking 
on the button to delete.
