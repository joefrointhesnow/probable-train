I wrote tests for the feature "Check accumulated time"

I wrote 3 tests for this story. 2 are happy paths where a student user is logged in.
in this case, if the users compensaition is less than compensaition limit, than the user should see their accumulated time.
if the users accumulated time is the compensation limit, than the user should see their accumulated time and a message that they are at max compensaition.

1 test is a sad path in which an admin user is logged in.
in this case the user should not see accumulated time.
