As a professor
I want to be able to create activities
So that I can assign and manage activities for a class
 
Scenario: creating an activity for a student 
  Given there is a link titled "Create Activity" 
  When I click on the "Create Activity"
  Then I should be on the Create Activity page
  And I should see five fields to insert information

Scenario: entering in the information of the activity
  Given I am on the Create Acitivty page
  When I insert the Activity Name
  And insert Activity Start Time
  And insert Activity End Time
  And insert Class Roster
  And insert Activity Location
  And I click on the Create Activity button
  Then I should see the activity on the Select Activity page
