Test was written for the add class roster feature with three scenarios. One of the scenarios is to make sure the user can
select the appropirate class roster if they're on the creating activity page. The other is similar to the first, the only
change is that the user is on the edit activity page, so they would be editing the class roster that is selected. 
These are the happy paths; for the sad paths, it would be that there is no class roster to choose from which in that 
case they will need to create one. 

** THE SAD PATH MIGHT HAVE A DIFFERENT PLAN IN THE END**
