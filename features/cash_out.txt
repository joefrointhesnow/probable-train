Test was written for the cash out feature with two scenarios. One of the scenarios is to make sure the user can
click on the earn cash button and generate a confirmation number and also send an email to both themselves and 
administrator. This would be the happy path. As for the sad path, the scenario is that the email is not sent
which therefore the confirmation number is not generated. It will tell the user on the cash out page that the
email was not sent.
